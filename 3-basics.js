// Truthy,Falsy values and equality operator, CHALLENGE 2

/******************************************
Truthy, Falsy values.
 ******************************************/
// Falsy values: undefined, null, 0, "", '', NaN. They return "false" when evaluated in a conditional statement.
// Truthy values: all the values that are not falsy.

// Because "height" isn't defined we would get the second console.log.
// But be careful since even a value of 0 is treated as "falsy" even though 0 is an actual value.
var height;
if(height){
    console.log("The variable is defined.");  
}
else{
    console.log("Variable has not been defined.");
}

// When testing for defined values, even if they're zeroes, we can do this "or" check:
var weight = 0;
if(weight || weight === 0){
    console.log("The variable weight is defined.");  
}
else{
    console.log("Variable weight has not been defined.");
}

/******************************************
Equality operators.
******************************************/
// The equality operator "==" checks type coercion. Meaning it will convert an int type like 23 into a string "23"
// and check if it's equal to "23".
console.log("Is '23' == 23?: " + (23 == "23"));

/******************************************
Strict equality.
******************************************/
// This checks for both the value and type to be equal.
console.log("Is '23' === 23?: " + (23 === "23"));
